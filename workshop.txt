description=[h1]The mod that adds Firearms from  The Last of Us games. [/h1]
description=This mod is a remaster of my precedent [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3007583105]The Last of Guns[/url] mod, taking a different approach. Instead of trying to bring The Last of Us gameplay and mechanics into Zomboid, I've simply added [u]and will continue to add[/u] guns and attachments (both found in the world and craftable) that fit 10 Years Later and The Last of Us universe.

description=This mod will be updated with the remaining guns, notably the flamethrower, aswell as adding even more attachments. If you have an suggestion for custom attachments that could be crafted or found in the world, don't hesitate to suggest them in the Discussions or in the comments.
description=
description=Informations I'd need on the attachment idea:
description=[olist]
description=[*] The type of attachment;
description=[*] If craftable, what kind of materials, skills, crafting animation it could have;
description=[*] If possible, some kind of reference for the visuals if it has any.
description=[/olist]
description=
description=Only vanilla materials and tools will be used for the crafting, reducing dependency to other mods.

description=[b][u]Is this mod Compatible with...[/u][/b]
description=[list]
description=[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2200148440]Brita[/url]/[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297098490]Arsenal[/url]:
description=Incompatible, guns don't spawn and don't work as intended (slower firerate).
description=[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2256623447]B41 Firearms[/url]/[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2667899942]Vanilla Firearm Expansion[/url]:
description=Compatible, but some attachments from TLOG won't properly attach to vanilla guns that are replaced by those two mods (Currently if one of those mods is running, TLOG attachments won't visually appear on Vanila guns, that these mods change models of, but will still have effect on said gun, for example Suppressors will still work, you just won't be seeing them on gun model. Its temporary fix.
description=[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2719327441]Snake's Mod Pack[/url]:
description=Not tested
description=[*] Any weapon mod that replaces vanilla guns will most likely cause problems with attachments not visually placed on the right spot on the guns.
description=[*] Most of TLOG attachments can be equiped on Vanila guns, and do not support custom guns added by other mods  (At least for now).

description=[b][u]Is it safe to install in ongoing saves ?[/u][/b]
description=Yes.
description=
description=[b][u]What happened to the upgrade system in the original mod using The Workshop ?[/u][/b]
description=Gone in favor of the vanilla attachment system.
description=
description=[b][u]Do guns use magazines ?[/u][/b]
description=Yes. Compared to the older mod, guns that should use magazines, will require them to be loaded. Guns will either use vanilla magazines or new ones that you should be able to find in the world or be able to craft.
description=
description=[b][u]Will you add this gun or attachment/upgrade ?[/u][/b]
description=More is to come, and like mentioned before, if you have ideas for any of these, feel free to comment about it or suggest it in within the suggestion discussion.
description=
description=[b][u]Does it include suppressors ?[/u][/b]
description=Yes! TLOG Remaster has working suppressors, that will lose condition everytime you shoot (by default, can be turned off in sandbox settings, aswell as adjusting chance of durability loss). They will work with vanila guns.
